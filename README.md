# 🌟 Spring-Gardium-Leviosa

Welcome to **Spring-Gardium-Leviosa**! This repository is filled with magical examples, code snippets, and technical
solutions crafted using Kotlin and Spring Boot. Inspired by the levitation charm *Wingardium Leviosa*, this project aims
to make your journey through technical challenges feel as effortless as lifting a feather.

## 🧙‍♂️ About the Repository

This repository is a companion to my technical blog posts, featuring Kotlin-Spring Boot examples that bring concepts to
life. Each blog post delves into a specific technical challenge, and this repository provides the code to illustrate
those challenges—making the solutions as clear and accessible as if you were magically levitating them right into your
hands.

## 📚 Content Overview

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/examples`**: Code examples to specific blog-posts.

## 🚀 Current Examples

- **`/archunit`**: Contains architecture tests using ArchUnit, a library for checking the architecture of Java
  codebases.
- **`/konsist`**: Contains architecture tests using Konsist, a Kotlin library for enforcing coding guidelines and
  architecture rules.
